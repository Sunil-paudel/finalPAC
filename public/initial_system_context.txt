The Rise of Enterprise Systems
• Problems with several standalone applications:
Employee needs to access one or more systems
Applications of different platforms difficult, and
expensive, to integrate
Same data stored on multiple systems (redundancy)
Updating data on one system, but not on another:
inconsistent data
Entering data on other systems to resolve
inconsistency: takes time and costly
 Solution: Enterprise system
• ES: IS spanning whole business and integrates
data, processes and activities from across all its
functional areas

areas, processes and decision-making in business

Supporting Business Processes

coordinating business processes with customers,
suppliers, business partners, etc. outside of
business

Improving Business Processes Through
Enterprise Systems
• Software is either Packaged (Off-the-shelf) software
or Custom software
• Packaged software: developed by vendor, for
businesses across the board, for standard tasks,
e.g., MS Office, taxation, etc.
• Custom software: developed specifically for a
business, for its particular situation
Business considers this if available packaged software
unsuitable and cost of development warranted
• Module: component of software chosen and applied
to system if needed
Usually, each replaces a system in a functional area,
e.g., finance NIT3114: Session 5 17

Enterprise Resource Planning
• Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system: IS
supporting activities across functional areas
• Don’t focus on “resource” and “planning” in
“Enterprise resource planning”, but on “enterprise”
• ERP provides modules for all functional areas
(replacing standalone applications) using central
database
• All data accessible by all areas, which is up-to-date
and consistent throughout
• UIs of modules have similar look-and-feel (same
background, menus, etc.), e.g., MS Office products
work differently, but similarity in appearance

Choosing an ERP System
• Business needs to choose carefully ERP to meet its
specific requirements
• Two important factors in choosing are as follows
ERP Control
• Control over parts of system, data and decision-
making
• Upper management of some businesses want full
control, others allow functional areas to control
• Upper management of some businesses want
detailed information for running it, others less
• Some businesses’ policies/procedures consistent
across business, others’ func. areas have own
NIT3114: Session 5 19
Copyright © 2018, 2016, 2014 Pearson Education, Ltd. All Rights Reserved
ERP Business Requirements
• Second factor in choosing ERP
• Business will choose subset of possible components
• Two types of ERP components: core and extended
• ERP core components: support internal activities
producing goods/services:
Manufacturing: support for manufacturing activities, etc.
Human resources: recruitment, payroll, performance
reviews, etc.
Finances: accounting, financial reporting, etc.
• ERP extended components: support external
activities dealing with suppliers and customers, e.g.,
fulfilling customers orders, managing customer
enquiries, etc. NIT3114: Session 5 20

Assessing Risks
• Information systems risk assessment: assessment
to get an understanding of risks relating to
availability, integrity and confidentiality of data and
systems
• Businesses identify and rank risks to develop best
security strategy
• Assessment includes hardware, software, data,
networks and any business processes involving
them, to identify threats and vulnerabilities
NIT3114: Session 10 16
Copyright © 2018, 2016, 2014 Pearson Education, Ltd. All Rights Reserved
Assessing Risks
• Threat: undesirable event that can cause harm
occurring from actions of perpetrator
• Vulnerability: weakness in a business’ system or
security policy exploitable to cause harm
• Impact: severity of effects of threat causing
damage by exploiting vulnerability

Assessing Risks
• Business designs and implements security strategy
to eliminate vulnerabilities or reduce impacts
• Also, business conducts security audits,
determining how effective measures have been
• Businesses uses technical information (e.g., about
database or networks) and non-technical
information (e.g., about processes or procedures)
• Information used to generate risk rating for each
asset or function
• Today, need to also consider: data on mobile
devices; data in cloud of cloud provider; sensors,
etc. in Internet of Things

Developing a Security Strategy
• After assessing risks, strategy specifies information
system controls
• ISC: process/procedure/measure/method assisting
in availability, integrity and confidentiality
• Types of controls:
Preventive: prevent negative event from occurring
Detective: recognise when anything went wrong (e.g.,
unauthorised access attempts) to limit damage
Corrective: reduce impact of any problem after occurred
(e.g., restoring compromised data)
• Use principle of least privilege: give employees
access to what is needed for carrying out duties,
but nothing more NIT3114: Session 10 20
Copyright © 2018, 2016, 2014 Pearson Education, Ltd. All Rights Reserved
Policies and Procedures
• Some security measures can be about changes to
business or better management of IS, like
acceptable use policies:
Confidential information policy: how sensitive
information handled, stored, transmitted and destroyed
Security policy: technical controls on all computer
systems, such as access limitations, firewalls, etc.
Use policy: appropriate use of in-house computer
systems, e.g., no Internet surfing, restricted use of social
e-mail, etc.
Backup policy: requirements for backing up information
Account management policy: procedures for adding new
users to systems and removing users

identification and authentication
NIT3114: Session 10 22
Copyright © 2018, 2016, 2014 Pearson Education, Ltd. All Rights Reserved
Physical access restrictions

Something you have: keys, smart cards, fobs, etc.
Something you know: password, PIN, answers to secret
questions, etc.
Something you are (Biometrics): fingerprint, facial
characteristics, etc.
• Biometrics: high security, efficient authentication
• Already: laptops/keyboards – fingerprint readers,
smartphones – fingerprint and facial recognition
• Multi-factor authentication: many different types of
credentials required to identify user
NIT3114: Session 10 23
Copyright © 2018, 2016, 2014 Pearson Education, Ltd. All Rights Reserved

acquired, all intended security features must be

evidence/clues
• Honeypot: computer, data or site on network
attractive to cracker; track them in illegal activity
 Collecting intelligence and catching criminals
